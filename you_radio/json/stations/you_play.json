Their chemistry has sparked rave reviews across the UK, as Alex continues to captivate audiences with her blend of folk, soul, and pop.</p><h5>A musical journey rooted in craft and collaboration</h5><p>Spotted at just 18 by producer Neil Stainton, Alex honed her songwriting skills and released her debut album On This Day, co-written with Torbay musician Barney Dine. Their close creative partnership helped shape her unique sound and paved the way for years of gigging, recording, and growing as a musician. Alex\u2019s collaboration with electronic duo Electronic Youth on a cover of Angie Stone\u2019s I Wish I Didn\u2019t Miss You hit No.2 on the Music Week Dance Charts and received airplay on BBC Radio 1, championed by Pete Tong. That breakout moment led to festival appearances and a support slot for Turin Brakes, catching the attention of OK!Good Records (US) and Right Track Records (UK), who quickly signed her.</p><h5>Touring the world and working with legends</h5><p>Alex Hart\u2019s talent caught the eye of Jethro Tull\u2019s Martin Barre, who invited her to tour internationally as a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist in his band. She's also a regular collaborator with Devon folk favourite Seth Lakeman, featuring heavily on his latest album. Their single Higher We Aspire earned support from BBC Radio 2, and Alex performed it live on BBC Breakfast TV. With regular tours across the UK, Europe, and the US, Alex Hart continues to evolve her sound while staying true to her roots.</p><h5>2025 and beyond</h5><p>Alex is currently working on new material set for release in 2025 and will continue touring with both Martin Barre and Seth Lakeman. Described by The Guardian as \u201cset to make a global impact,\u201d she\u2019s an artist to watch. Listen to Alex Hart\u2019s most personal work yet \u2014 Visions \u2014 available now on CD, Vinyl or digital download via Bandcamp or her official website.</p><p>Like what you hear?

In many cases, artists see only a fraction of the earnings from their work, with the majority being absorbed by their record labels. Furthermore, artists are often pressured to produce commercially viable material rather than exploring new or experimental sounds. This corporate need to generate consistent income leads to unadventurous, formulaic music where creativity takes a back seat to marketability.</p><p>The YouPlay business opportunity is ground-breaking for the music industry in that we provide a FREE platform, using the universally popular medium of radio, for artists to showcase their talent, control their careers and the option of monetisation to enable artists to generate their own revenue free from corporate interference.</p><p>If you\u2019re an artist and would like your own YouPlay radio station, contact us today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
